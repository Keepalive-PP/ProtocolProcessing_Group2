The goal of this project was to study BGP-protocol and its functions
as an inter domain routing protocol of the Internet. The method was to
build software that simulates those BGP functions. We spent several
weeks for researching BPG-protocol standards and identifying the
required aspects for building a working BGP-simulator. As an outcome of
the researching process, we gained a strong knowledge of network
protocols in general, as well as how those different protocols
intervene in currently used BGP-networks. In addition, we adopted a
strong knowledge on router architectures and configurations, and  in IP-packet processing on the network layer (bit level
processing). The information extracted during the research phase was
put directly into the use in the BGP-simulator's design phase. We had
to define the datatypes, classes and logic to store, transfer, and process all the
data on BGP-simulator. Furthermore, we had to build a working and usable
user interface for users to configure and control the simulation.

All in all, this project provided a perfect way to get at the deep end
of BGP-protocol and Internet routing on BGP-level. Although it took relatively
long time to get the simulation software finished and running, we
think that there is no better way to gain as strong practical
knowledge on the network protocols and protocol processing
as we have been able to do during this project. This extremely
interesting project has been an outstanding learning experience and
will for sure give us strength and motivation for our future
projects. We also have a strong will to continue the development of
the BGP-simulator in the direction mentioned in the previous chapter.
