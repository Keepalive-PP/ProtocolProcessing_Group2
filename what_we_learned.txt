In this project goal was to get familiar with BGP-protocol and structure of BGP-networks, and from that information build simulation software for BGP. We spent several weeks at the beginning of this project just researching BPG-protocol standards and trying to figure out what aspects are needed to build a working BGP-network. This provided us with vast knowledge of network protocols and how the different communication protocols interwine in currently used BGP-networks. We had to study BGP-routers and their common configuration. We had to find out how to define IP-layer inside the BGP-simulation to transfer packets at bit-level. On top of all the new protocols and standards to be learned and implemented, we had to figure out the datatypes and classes to store and process all the information needed to run BGP-network, and we had to build working and usable interface for the user to configure the simulation and get data from simulation.

So all in all, this project has been great way to get at the deep end of BGP-protocol and networking at BGP-level. It took relatively long time to get this simulation software finished and running, but we feel that there is no better way to get this much of practical knowledge. It has been interesting project and awesome learning experience. We will probably continue the development even further to reach the goals mentioned in the previous chapter.
